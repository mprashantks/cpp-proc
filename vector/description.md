# 3D Vector
3-dimensional vector implementation.

## Functionalities
1. Create vector
2. Find vector magnitude
3. Reset vector to different values
4. Negate vector
5. Add vectors
6. Subtract vectors
7. Constant and vector multiplication
8. Dot product of vectors
9. Cross product of vectors

## Design choice
1. Program is built on top of principles of OOPs and operator overloading.
2. Objects are passed as reference to save time and space.
3. Friend functions are employed to enforce commutative property and understandable programming logic.
